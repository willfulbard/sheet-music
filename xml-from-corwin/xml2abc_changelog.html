	* Revision: 161
	- added auto value (-1) to --fin and remover --nofin
	- renamed edomix to edomap and reused edomix for fractional edo36 values
	- new option --temp (0=auto choice edo: 12, 36 or 53, 1=force edo53 and map
	edo36, 2=use fractional edo36 values when mixing edo 53 and 36
	- only autodetect encoder when microtonal accidentals present
	--fin=3 always show accidentals and ignore pitch-alter (finale)
	--fin=2 use musescore rules for accidentals (musescore)
	--fin=1 same as 2 but always use current alteration when no pitch-alter
	(burak)
	--fin=0 same as 2 but also honor microtonal pitch-alter values
	--fin=-1 automatic detection of encoder if finale or burak, otherwise
	musescore

	* Revision: 160
	- option --fin, when set pitch-alterations are ignored for microtonal
	accidentals This seems to be the logic presently followed by finale and
	musescore
	- auto-detect musescore/finale and set --fin if detected
	- option --nofin disables auto-detection

2025-03-06

	* Revision: 159
	- when a tune uses %%MIDI temperamentequal 36, replace ^3 by ^ and _3 by _
	(because 3*12/36 == 1)

2025-02-17

	* Revision: 158
	- added a couple of regression test files with microtonal accidentals

	* Revision: 157
	- bug in return value of alt2acc when float alter value
	- accept floating alter if +/-1.0, 0.0 or +/-0.5
	- do not add natural (converted from alter) if no current alteration (or key
	alteration)
	- (test function) better option handling in regression04.py

2025-02-16

	* Revision: 156
	- change internal representation of accidentals to the corresponding
	MusicXML textstings. (mapping double-flat to flat-flat and the same for
	sharp)
	- recognize Edo36 accidentals (natural-up, sharp-down etc.) and translate them
	to _4, _3, ... ^3, ^4 (flat-down, flat, .. sharp, sharp-up)
	- new option "no36" to map Edo36 accidentals to Edo53: most up/down variants
	are mapped to quarter-sharp and quarter-flat
	- new functions acc2abc and alt2acc to support the new internal representation
	of accidentals

2025-02-10

	* Revision: 155
	- accidental type natural-up/down added
	- proper error message when accidental type not supported
	- also accept musicxml extension within .mxl files

2025-02-05

	* Revision: 154
	- follow probable bug in Musescore: hide accidental when alteration is
	defined in a key-step element, even if an explicit accidental element is
	present. When the key is defined by a &lt;fifths&gt; element the accidental is not
	hidden when the same alteration is in the key!

2025-01-31

	* Revision: 153
	- better order for translation of accidental/alteration
	- add "%%MIDI temperamentequal 53" to the output when file has edo53
	accidentals
	- another list(map(...)) bug for python3 (when translating tablature)

2025-01-29

	* Revision: 152
	- translation of microtone accidentals using nine comma's per octave (EDO
	53) and %%MIDI temperamentequal 53
	- remove option --nonat again

2025-01-21

	* Revision: 151
	- also store key-alter values, and correct them for non-standards values as
	encountered in xml files of the SimbTr collection.
	- remember the staff of alterations as an ABC voice may switch staff
	- option --nonat avoids forced naturals, when alter element is missing for a
	note that follows the same but altered note. This avoids a bug in Finale and
	MuseScore, where alter elements are never saved for non-traditional
	alterations)
	- the nonat option also follows the traditional accidental rules for non-
	traditional key signatures
	- do not let the &lt;accidental&gt; take precedence over the &lt;alter&gt; when option
	nonat is present *and* pitch-alter equals value from the accidental (this is
	for xml files from SimbTr collection)

2025-01-20

	* Revision: 150
	- added --nonat option for non-traditional accidentals. (for Finale and
	MuseScore xml that save no or wrong &lt;alter&gt; values for most non-traditional
	accidentals)

2025-01-19

	* Revision: 149
	- translation of non-traditional key signatures

	* Revision: 148
	- translation of quarter-flat, flat-up and sharp-down
	- bug in perc2map for py3: transform map object to proper list

2024-06-05

	* Revision: 147
	- corrected a boolean test to get rid of another deprecation warning in
	python 3.12 (again no changes needed in xml2abc-js, because javascript
	maintains backwards compatility, in sharp constrast to python)

2024-05-02

	* Revision: 146
	- corrected escape sequences that caused deprecation warnings (and syntax
	warnings as of python 3.12)

2023-03-29

	* Revision: 145
	- added function vertaal() as an interface when xml2abc is used as a library
	- the info function stores diagnostic messages in a global list and only
	writes these messages so stderr when xml2abc is run as main program

2023-02-18

	* Revision: 144
	- updated tabDrumDoc.html
	- handle start and stop of wavy-line on a single note
	- put stop of wavy-line after the ABC note

2021-04-12

	* Revision: 143
	- percmap translation changed (option -t) The %%voicemap line now comes
	after %%MIDI lines (if any)

2020-07-23

	* Revision: 142
	- merged patch from Martin Tarenskeen with corrections for Python3
